# Project Unicorn - intnav

Project Unicorn is a project for AMOD Fall 2018 (ETH ZÃ¼rich) course that focuses on Intersection Navigation for duckiebots in Duckietown.

duckietown-intnav contains the code to implement the intersection navigation demo on a duckiebot. The general idea of the projects consists of a 4-step approach to efficiently navigate the 3 and 4-way intersections: 

1- Starting at a red line at any intersection, the duckiebot estimates its initial pose.

2- Different paths for going left, right and straight are pre-computed and chosen depending on the desired intersection exit.

3- Constantly updating its pose estimate, it follows the path in a closed-loop manner with a PurePursuit controller.

4- Detects when the duckiebot has reached the intersection end (exit lane) and switches back to the duckietown lane follower.

The interested reader can find more details in the [project documentation.](http://docs.duckietown.org/DT18/opmanual_duckiebot/out/demo_projectunicorn.html)

## Software architecture

TODO: Paste from the report

## Installation from source

We recommend to run our package natively: 

    $ cd lib-intnav
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt --user
    $ python setup.py develop --no-deps --user

To run the package using a virtual environment created by `pipenv` the following steps are necessary:

    $ pipenv install
    $ pipenv shell
    $ cd lib-intnav
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python setup.py develop --no-deps

## Unit tests

Run this:

    $ make -C lib-intnav tests-clean tests
    
The output is generated in the folder in `lib-intnav/out-comptests/`.
